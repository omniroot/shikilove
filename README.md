- [x] Planning - design, functionality

  - [x] Alpha - Working application implementing 80% of the functionality ( + closed testing )
  - [ ] Beta - 100% of the functionality, preparing for release, collecting feedback, improving UX ( + open testing )
  - [ ] Optimization - This is a big stage of project development, as big as the problem with the performance of web applications. The most difficult stage on which I will spend much more time than others ( + refactoring)
  - [ ] Release - Stable version, everything planned has been implemented and works fine, I hope...

- [ ] Documentation (handbook) - A big chapter in my becoming a programmer. Understand what a developer needs for comfortable implementation in an open source project
